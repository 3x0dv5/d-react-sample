# AGENTS

This repository hosts a dynamic dashboard built with React, Vite, and TypeScript. The guidance below applies to the entire project.

## Code
- Use TypeScript and React functional components with hooks.
- Keep code formatted with 2-space indentation, single quotes, and semicolons. Run `npx prettier -w <files>` if formatting is required.
- Prefer relative imports within the `src` directory.

## Documentation
- Place new documentation in the `docs` directory.
- Use Markdown and Mermaid for diagrams; split large diagrams into smaller focused ones.

## Testing
- Always run `npm test` after making changes.
- For TypeScript or build-related changes, also run `npm run build` to ensure the project compiles.

## Commits
- Write clear, concise commit messages describing your changes.
- Do not amend or rebase existing commits.
